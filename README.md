# Guess-Number-Game

This is a simple number guessing game implemented using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The game allows the user to guess a number between 0-20. If the user correctly guesses the number, the screen color changes and a message is displayed congratulating the user for guessing the correct number.

If the user guesses the wrong number, points are deducted from their score starting from 20. At the end of the game, the user has the option to start a new game. The user's score is compared to their previously saved score and if the current score is greater, it is saved as their highest score.
